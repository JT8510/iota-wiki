# IOTA Sandbox

![IOTA Sandbox](/img/banner/banner_iota_sandbox.svg)

The IOTA Sandbox is a dedicated local network for developers to prototype and test smart contracts, INX plugins, and L1 applications within the IOTA ecosystem. It provides a safe, isolated environment for development and experimentation, crucial for ensuring functionality before deployment in production scenarios. 

:::note

The IOTA Sandbox is not intended for creating production-ready networks, but rather for research and development purposes only. Also always consider using the [public testnet](https://wiki.iota.org/build/networks-endpoints/#public-testnet) first. Join us in pioneering the next wave of IOTA innovations, where you can experiment with confidence and community support.
